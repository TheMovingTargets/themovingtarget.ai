# The Moving Target — Website Strategy Summary

## 1. Positioning Statement

**The Moving Target** is a monthly podcast and knowledge hub where two builders—Sidd Gupta and Avyay Misra—explore the practical reality of AI, automation, and agentic systems. We cut through the hype to discuss what's actually working, what's overpromised, and what operators need to know.

Beyond the podcast, we build. Our flagship agent MARIA helps teams coordinate, train, and communicate more effectively—starting with hospitality and service-heavy businesses.

**Brand Essence:** High-signal, approachable expertise. No buzzwords. No fluff. Just real conversations and real tools.
