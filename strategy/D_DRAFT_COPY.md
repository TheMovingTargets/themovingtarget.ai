## ABOUT PAGE

### Story Section
**Headline:** THE STORY

**Body:**
The Moving Target started with a simple observation: everyone talks about AI, but few discuss what it's actually like to build and deploy.

We wanted to change that.

Sidd and Avyay started recording monthly conversations about what they're seeing in the field—what's working, what's overhyped, and what operators actually need to know. No script, no agenda, just two builders talking shop.

The podcast grew. So did the work. Today, The Moving Target is both a show and a studio—where we record honest conversations and build practical tools like MARIA.

The target keeps moving. We're here to help you track it.

**Headline:** YOUR HOSTS

### What We Care About Section
**Headline:** WHAT WE CARE ABOUT

- **Building useful, real-world AI** — Not demos. Production systems that solve real problems.
- **Honest conversations** — About what works, what doesn't, and why.
- **Practical outcomes** — Time saved, friction reduced, teams supported.
- **Helping operators** — The people on the ground making decisions every day.
